# Story 7.11: Previous NDA Context Display

## Status
ready-for-dev

## Story
As a **NDA User**,
I want **to see previous NDAs for a company**,
So that **I can understand patterns and ensure consistency**.

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I am creating an NDA for a company
**When** the company has previous NDAs
**Then** I see "Previous NDAs" section showing last 5 NDAs with this company
**And** can click to view or clone

## Tasks / Subtasks
⚠️ **DRAFT TASKS** - Generated from requirements analysis. Will be validated and refined against actual codebase when dev-story runs.

- [ ] Review existing data model and services for template/configuration support (AC: 1)
- [ ] Implement or verify backend routes/services with RBAC + agency scoping (AC: 1-3)
- [ ] Implement or verify frontend UI flows for admin/user interactions (AC: 1-3)
- [ ] Add/verify audit logging, validation, and error handling (AC: 1-3)
- [ ] Add/verify unit/integration tests for critical paths (AC: 1-3)

## Gap Analysis
_This section will be populated by dev-story when gap analysis runs._

## Dev Notes
- Keep all NDA queries scoped to authorized subagencies.
- Ensure permission checks use middleware and RBAC permissions.
- Audit log all mutations in transactions.

### Technical Requirements
- Implements FR94: Show "previous NDAs for this company" context

## Architecture Constraints
- Follow the service-layer pattern: business logic in `src/server/services`, no raw HTTP inside services.
- Enforce middleware order on protected routes: `authenticateJWT` → `attachUserContext` → `requirePermission` → `scopeToAgencies` → handler.
- Every NDA query must be scoped by authorized subagency IDs (row-level security).
- All mutations must create audit logs (transactional with data change).
- Do not store tokens in localStorage; use HttpOnly cookies set by server.
- Use Prisma for data access; do not bypass ORM constraints.
- Frontend uses React + Vite + TypeScript; backend uses Express + TypeScript.

### Project Structure Notes
- Frontend: `src/client` (pages, components, hooks, contexts, stores).
- Backend: `src/server` (routes, services, middleware, validators, utils).
- Database: `prisma/schema.prisma` + migrations under `prisma/migrations`.
- Tests: `__tests__` next to implementation where applicable.

### Testing Requirements
- Add or confirm unit/integration coverage for routes/services touched.
- Include negative tests for permission denial and scope violations where applicable.
