# Story 7.2: RTF Template Management

## Status
review

## Story
As a **Admin**,
I want **to edit, organize, and delete RTF templates**,
So that **I can maintain an up-to-date template library**.

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I am viewing the RTF templates list
**When** I select a template
**Then** I can: Edit, Delete (with confirmation), Duplicate, Set as default for agency/type, Archive (soft delete)
**And** deleting warns if it's currently set as default

## Tasks / Subtasks
⚠️ **DRAFT TASKS** - Generated from requirements analysis. Will be validated and refined against actual codebase when dev-story runs.

- [x] Review existing data model and services for template/configuration support (AC: 1)
- [x] Implement or verify backend routes/services with RBAC + agency scoping (AC: 1-3)
~~- [ ] Implement or verify frontend UI flows for admin/user interactions (AC: 1-3)~~
- [x] Add delete confirmation warning when template is default (AC: 1)
- [x] Add/verify audit logging, validation, and error handling (AC: 1-3)
- [x] Add/verify unit/integration tests for critical paths (AC: 1-3)

## Gap Analysis

### Pre-Development Analysis
- **Date:** 2026-01-03
- **Development Type:** greenfield (no file list in story; existing implementation found in codebase)
- **Existing Files:** 4
- **New Files:** 0

**Findings:**
- Tasks ready: 1 (default delete warning UI)
- Tasks partially done: 0
- Tasks already complete: 4
- Tasks refined: 1
- Tasks added: 0

**Codebase Scan:**
- Backend: `src/server/routes/templates.ts`, `src/server/services/templateService.ts`
- Frontend: `src/components/screens/Templates.tsx`
- Tests: `src/server/services/__tests__/templateService.test.ts`

**Status:** Ready for implementation

### Post-Implementation Validation
- **Date:** 2026-01-03
- **Tasks Verified:** 5
- **False Positives:** 0
- **Status:** ✅ All work verified complete

**Verification Evidence:**
- ✅ Data model/services: `prisma/schema.prisma`, `src/server/services/templateService.ts`
- ✅ Backend routes/RBAC: `src/server/routes/templates.ts`
- ✅ Frontend UI flows: `src/components/screens/Templates.tsx`
- ✅ Audit logging/validation: `src/server/services/templateService.ts`, `src/server/routes/templates.ts`
- ✅ Tests: `src/server/services/__tests__/templateService.test.ts`

## Smart Batching Plan

No batchable patterns detected (single UI change).

## Dev Notes
- Keep all NDA queries scoped to authorized subagencies.
- Ensure permission checks use middleware and RBAC permissions.
- Audit log all mutations in transactions.

### Technical Requirements
- Implements FR83: Edit RTF templates
- Implements FR84: Organize templates
- Soft delete pattern (is_archived boolean)

## Architecture Constraints
- Follow the service-layer pattern: business logic in `src/server/services`, no raw HTTP inside services.
- Enforce middleware order on protected routes: `authenticateJWT` → `attachUserContext` → `requirePermission` → `scopeToAgencies` → handler.
- Every NDA query must be scoped by authorized subagency IDs (row-level security).
- All mutations must create audit logs (transactional with data change).
- Do not store tokens in localStorage; use HttpOnly cookies set by server.
- Use Prisma for data access; do not bypass ORM constraints.
- Frontend uses React + Vite + TypeScript; backend uses Express + TypeScript.

### Project Structure Notes
- Frontend: `src/client` (pages, components, hooks, contexts, stores).
- Backend: `src/server` (routes, services, middleware, validators, utils).
- Database: `prisma/schema.prisma` + migrations under `prisma/migrations`.
- Tests: `__tests__` next to implementation where applicable.

### Testing Requirements
- Add or confirm unit/integration coverage for routes/services touched.
- Include negative tests for permission denial and scope violations where applicable.
